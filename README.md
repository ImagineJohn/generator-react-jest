# React Redux Jest Starter Kit

## Motivation
 I do a ton of POCs at work and personal projects, this is a simple boilerplate that sets up a simple
 react redux jest app so that you don't have to do much. I also have another package that is a react redux
 karma starter kit... But it turns out that karma/mocha/chai is horrible compared to jest, the configuration
 is so painless with jest so I wanted to create another starter app.
 
## How to install
 mkdir `newdir && cd newdir`<br>
 `npm init -y`<br>
 `npm install react-redux-jest-starter-kit`<br>
 
**NOTE** if you `--save` or `--save-dev` then this will clear out your project every single time you do npm 
install! So don't do it!

## After install
Go ahead and run `npm start` and that will start a webpack-dev-server on port 8080, or even run 
`npm test` which will run test cases with coverage generated!
