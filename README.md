# React Jest Generator

## Motivation
 I do a ton of POCs at work and personal projects, this is a simple boilerplate that sets up a simple
 react redux jest app so that you don't have to do much. I also have another package that is a react redux
 karma starter kit... But it turns out that karma/mocha/chai is horrible compared to jest, the configuration
 is so painless with jest so I wanted to create another starter app.
 
## NOTE
Do not use this as of right now. Still under construction
